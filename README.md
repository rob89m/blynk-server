# Blynk Server Docker Image

Runs your own [Blynk Server](https://github.com/blynkkk/blynk-server) in a Docker container instead of relying on Blynk's public server.

[Blynk](http://www.blynk.cc) is the "first drag-n-drop IoT app builder for Arduino, Raspberry Pi, ESP8266, SparkFun boards, and others." Super fun.

## How To Use It

Easy peasy:

```sh
docker run rob89m/blynk-server:latest
```

To forward IP ports from the host to the container, do this:

```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8441:8441 -p 9443:9443 rob89m/blynk-server:latest
```

To persist data, mount a directory into the container:

```sh
docker run -v $(PWD):/data rob89m/blynk-server:latest
```

To include your own server.properties file, mount it into /config/server.properties

```sh
docker run -v $(PWD)/server.properties:/config/server.properties rob89m/blynk-server:latest
```

Or you can use a data volume in another container (check out different data volume techniques [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/)).
